## Basic Usage

```js
// @file ReactComponentSubscribed.js
import ReactComponent from './ReactComponent';
import Store from 'stores/Store';
import Actions from 'actions/Actions';
import subscription from 'ship-components-subscribe';

/**
 * Returns a Component that listens to a store
 * @return    {React.Component}
 */
export default subscription({
  WrappedComponent: ReactComponent,
  Store,
  selectData: store => store.getState(),
  callAction: () => Actions.read(),
  interval: 30000
});

```
The following component isn't directly used since we're wrapping using the higher order component above. Since we don't need to listen to the store we can use a pure function here.
```js
// @file ReactComponent.js
import React from 'react';

export default function ReactComponent(props) {
  const {
    data // This is managed by the subscribe component and is the result of `selectData`
  } = this.props;
  return (
    <div>
      {data}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Once we've wrapped a component we then import the wrapped component.

```js
// @file ExampleView.js
import React from 'react';

// NOTE we're importing the subscribed component here
import ReactComponent from './ReactComponentSubscribed.js';

export function ExampleView(props) {
  return (
    <ReactComponent />
  )
}
```
